## 30‑second version (Azure‑focused)

Hi—I’m Mark Holahan. I’m finishing Springboard’s Data Engineering Boot Camp focused on Microsoft Azure. I build Spark ETL in Azure Databricks and schedule it as Databricks Jobs/Workflows; development is Python‑centric, and I bring 25 years of SQL with legacy RDBMS. My Airflow mini‑project was a highlight, and I enjoy turning messy data into reliable, fast pipelines. I’m targeting Junior Data Engineer or Data Engineer roles on Azure. Would you be open to a brief intro with someone building Azure pipelines?

------

## 20‑second version (concise networking)

I’m Mark Holahan, training in data engineering with a focus on Azure. I’ve built Databricks/Spark ETL, orchestrated jobs with Airflow, and done SQL performance work. I’m excited about dependable data pipelines that power analytics. Do you know anyone working on Azure data pipelines who’d be open to a brief intro?

------

## 45–60‑second “Tell me about yourself” (expanded)

I’m Mark Holahan. I’m completing Springboard’s Data Engineering Boot Camp and focusing on Microsoft Azure. My strengths are: translating business needs into clean data models, building Databricks/Spark ETL that’s testable and documented, and using Airflow to keep pipelines reliable. Recently I built an Azure ETL mini‑project end‑to‑end, explored Spark optimization patterns, and prototyped a Kafka streaming pipeline. I enjoy the craft—clean code, version control, and good runbooks. I’m aiming for junior data‑engineering roles on Azure. Would you be open to connecting me with someone hiring or open to an informational chat?

------

## Recruiter/HR version (straight to value)

I’m Mark Holahan. I’m training in Azure‑centric data engineering: Databricks/Spark ETL, Airflow orchestration, SQL tuning, and data modeling. I’m looking for junior data‑engineering roles where I can build and maintain reliable pipelines on Azure. Is there a team hiring for Azure data engineering that I should speak with?

------

## Career‑coach version (to send to Ramone)

Hi Ramone—quick elevator pitch I’m using:
 I’m a data‑engineering candidate focused on Azure. I build Databricks/Spark ETL and schedule it with Databricks Jobs/Workflows; my development has been Python‑centric, and I bring 25 years of SQL and legacy RDBMS experience. I also completed an Apache Airflow mini‑project that I found challenging and interesting. I like turning messy data into trustworthy, fast pipelines. I’m targeting Junior Data Engineer or Data Engineer roles on Azure. Could you share feedback and suggest any intros or target companies?

------

## Optional closers (choose one)

- “Are you open to a quick intro to anyone building Azure data pipelines?”
- “Who on your team focuses on data ingestion or orchestration that I might talk with?”
- “What skills would make a junior data engineer stand out on your team?”

------

## Fill‑in helpers (small edits to personalize)

- **Target roles:** junior data engineer • data engineer • analytics engineer • platform data engineer
- **Target stack keywords:** Azure • Databricks • Spark • Airflow • Kafka • SQL • data modeling • CI/CD • Git/GitHub
- **Recent project (swap one line):** “Recently I [built/refactored] [X] that [ingests/transforms] [data type] in [tool], documented in GitHub with tests and a simple runbook.”
- **Passion (swap one line):** “I like the craft—clean data models, readable code, and pipelines that fail loudly and recover predictably.”

## DM/Email template (cold outreach)

Subject: Quick intro — Azure‑focused data‑engineering candidate

Hi [Name], I’m training in Azure‑centric data engineering (Databricks/Spark, Airflow, SQL). I enjoy building reliable pipelines and recently completed small projects in Azure ETL, Spark optimization, and Kafka streaming. I’m exploring junior roles and would value a brief intro to anyone working on Azure data pipelines. Would a 10–15 minute chat be okay next week?

## LinkedIn DM (2 sentences)

Hi {{First Name}} — I’m Mark Holahan, an Azure‑focused data engineer in training; I build Databricks/Spark ETL and schedule it with Databricks Jobs/Workflows, and I bring 25 years of SQL/RDBMS. I’m exploring junior Data Engineer roles—would you be open to a quick 10–15 minute chat or an intro to someone working on Azure data pipelines? (I also completed an Airflow mini‑project.)

------

## 10‑second “doorway” pitch

Azure‑focused data engineer: Databricks/Spark ETL scheduled with Databricks Jobs/Workflows; Python‑centric; 25 years SQL/RDBMS. Targeting junior data‑engineering roles—anyone you’d recommend I meet?

------

## 30‑second version (Azure‑native phrasing)

Hi—I’m Mark Holahan. Azure‑focused data engineer in training: Spark ETL in Databricks, scheduled natively with Databricks Jobs/Workflows; comfortable integrating with Azure Data Factory when teams prefer it. Python‑centric with 25 years of SQL/RDBMS. Targeting Junior Data Engineer or Data Engineer roles—happy to connect with anyone building Azure data pipelines.

------

## Stack phrasing cheat‑sheet (believable & precise)

**Say this:**

- “Spark ETL in Azure Databricks; scheduled as Databricks Jobs/Workflows.”
- “I completed an Apache Airflow mini‑project and can run Databricks tasks from Airflow when a team standardizes on it.”
- “Comfortable integrating with Azure Data Factory/Fabric Data Factory when that’s the org’s orchestrator.”

**Avoid this blanket claim:**

- “I orchestrate Databricks with Airflow” (unless you’re joining an Airflow‑first team).

**Optional one‑line stack (resume/pitch):**
 Azure • Databricks (Spark, Delta) • Databricks Jobs/Workflows • Python • SQL (25 yrs) • Kafka (project)

## Iteration 3 — Portfolio‑anchored variants

### 30‑second (portfolio‑anchored, Azure‑native)

Hi—I’m Mark Holahan. Azure‑focused data engineer in training. I build Spark ETL in Azure Databricks and schedule it as Databricks Jobs/Workflows. My public portfolio has 10+ mini‑projects plus capstones—recent highlights: a Kafka fraud‑detection demo, an Airflow log‑analyzer, and a Synapse pipeline from ADLS with schema‑drift handling. Python‑centric with 25 years of SQL/RDBMS. I’m targeting Junior Data Engineer or Data Engineer roles on Azure—open to a quick intro?

### 20‑second (automation‑first)

I keep my GitHub portfolio auto‑generated via Python + SQL Server metadata—the same discipline I bring to pipelines: codify, schedule, verify. Core stack: Databricks Spark ETL with Databricks Jobs/Workflows; Synapse pipeline; Kafka streaming demo; Airflow project; 25 years SQL/RDBMS. Exploring junior Azure data‑engineering roles—who should I meet?

### 45–60‑second “Tell me about yourself” (evidence‑based)

I’m Mark Holahan. I’m finishing Springboard’s DE program focused on Microsoft Azure. I ship Spark ETL in Databricks, scheduled natively with Databricks Jobs/Workflows, and I document with runbooks and health checks. My portfolio is a meta‑repo whose README and project pages are auto‑generated by a Python workflow from a SQL Server tracker—so progress and links stay current. Projects span streaming and orchestration (Kafka demo; Airflow log analyzer), warehousing (Synapse pipeline from ADLS with type‑2 style updates and schema‑drift handling), and performance (Spark optimization, PostgreSQL/MySQL tuning). Development is Python‑centric; I bring 25 years of SQL and legacy RDBMS experience. I’m aiming for junior DE roles on Azure—could you point me to a hiring manager or make an intro?

### 10‑second doorway (portfolio‑anchored)

Azure + Databricks Spark ETL with Databricks Jobs/Workflows; Synapse pipeline; Kafka & Airflow projects; portfolio auto‑generated via Python+SQL Server; 25 yrs SQL.
