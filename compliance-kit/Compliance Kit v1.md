## 3. Story Toolbox (Behavioral Q&A)

**Q1: Why do you want to be a data engineer?**
 I’ve always thrived on solving tough data problems. After decades as a data architect, I wanted to re-tool with modern cloud-native tools like Spark and Airflow. I enjoy building systems that turn raw data into something usable, and I see data engineering as the backbone of today’s analytics-driven companies.

**Q2: Why do you want to work at this company?**
 I’m targeting companies that value strong data foundations and invest in modern platforms. From my research, [Company] has made data central to its strategy, and that aligns with my passion for building scalable pipelines that empower analytics and decision-making.

**Q3: Tell me about a time you handled conflict with colleagues.**
 At NRG, I worked with BI developers who wanted new features quickly, while my priority was data reliability. I suggested weekly checkpoints where we reviewed sprint goals together. That gave stakeholders visibility while letting me safeguard data integrity. The result: fewer escalations and smoother delivery.
